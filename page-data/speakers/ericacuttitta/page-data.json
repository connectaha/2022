There she grew the Genetic Biocomputing team from 9 staff to over 40 while improving diversity from 11% to 45% and implementing mentoring and sponsorship programs to elevate the next generation of leaders. \nNow at Pluralsight as a Sr. Director of Software Engineering, Erica uses her empathetic and optimistic leadership style to propel high performing teams forward. A techie by training and a passionate mentor, she brings an inspirational and empowering leadership style to all those who cross her path. In her short time at Pluralsight, she co-founded Women + Allies Coffee, pushed Mental Health initiatives, rebooted the Leadership Guild, and has become an outspoken advocate for all in tech, especially minorities. \nTo relax, she can be found trail running, fly-fishing, cross-stitching swear words or attempting to keep 3 small humans alive with her partner, Steve, at their home in Park City.","marks":[],"data":{}}]}]}},"abstract":{"json":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"We are all driven by continuous improvement, high quality and value for our customers.
