At Hudl, we shook that up. We coined the phrase “learning by making” and asked every role (product mangers, engineers, scrum masters, designers, quality analysts) to make prototypes. It was messy (like really messy) and didn’t always work. We threw away a lot of attempts. But sometimes messy is the magic. This work resulted in a happier team, not just happier designers. Users and customers were involved more than ever. I’ll share actual stories of when this worked and when it fell flat. I’ll include principles we learned along the way and how managers + leaders play crucial roles.
